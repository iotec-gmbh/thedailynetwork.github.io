## Make it easy to connect

Typing cryptic passwords in your smartphone or laptop is tiring and time consuming.
One single mistype and the whole procedure has to be repeated. 

**The Daily Network** makes it much more easy to connect to, especially for smartphones.
Simply take a photo of the QR-Code on the Screen and  automatically connect to the WiFi.

And even if you type in the password by your own.
Since we change the password every day, we can use smaller password lengths without the fear of weakening our security.
You will be finished in a flash.

## Don't keep Guests forever

Only because your customers and guests are allowed to connect once to your network does not mean that they can keep this connection forever.
Most guests are only staying for a day, so **The Daily Network** changes its password on a daily manner to revoke the access after 24 hours.

## Separate the Guest Network

Guests and Customers should be allowed to access the Internet, but not your personal services and assests.
Therefore **The Daily Network** separates the guest network from your own private one.
