## Make it easy to connect

Typing cryptic passwords in your smartphone or laptop is tiring and time consuming.
One single mistype and the whole procedure has to be repeated. 

**The Daily Network** makes it much more easy to connect to, especially for smartphones.
Simply take a photo of the QR-Code on the Screen and  automatically connect to the WiFi.

And even if you type in the password by your own.
Since we change the password every day, we can use smaller password lengths without the fear of weakening our security.
You will be finished in a flash.

## You don't want your guests to overstay 

Having guests is nice and you want to provide a pleasant stay for them by providing free WiFi. But you also don't want your guests to stay forever - especially in your WiFi. **The Daily Network** provides you with a simple way to manage use of your WiFi. By simply changing the password in a regular interval (24 hours, but configurable to your needs), access to your internet connection is automatically revoked for anyone who does not have access to the sign in your conference room.

## Separate the Guest Network

Guests and Customers should be allowed to access the Internet, but not your personal services and assests.
Therefore **The Daily Network** separates the guest network from your own private one.
